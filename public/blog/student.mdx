When I joined the typing team, all of the students had to practice typing using Google Slides. The teacher couldn’t really see our progress and didn’t know if we were actually typing the practice texts correctly. Typing Help is really helpful (it lives up to its name 😄) because the teacher can actually see if we are typing the samples correctly and knows the area that we need the most help. We also know if we are typing correctly, because when we just typed in the Google slides, we couldn't tell whether we were typing correctly. But with this app, we can tell if we are typing correctly and if we’ve improved. Usually when we type, our teacher sets a four-minute timer and when we practice on our own we have to find some random timer online (at least that’s what I did ). But with Typing Help, I can just start with the four-minute timer and start practice. That’s why this is helpful.
