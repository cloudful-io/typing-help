Going back to the root of why I build Typing Help, my goal is for the Chinese typing team teacher to be able to create typing assignments for her students.  Observing how she was managing her weekly Zoom sessions, I realized that an obvious benefit of Typing Help would be for her to be able to view her students' progress as her students practice weekly.  Classroom mode allows a teacher to create a class where students can join using an alphanumeric (6 digits or letters) join code.  After the class is created, a teacher can create typing assignments.  Students, on the other hand, can practice as many as they want to achieve progress towards better speed and/or accuracy of typing.  Teachers will be able to see statistics of all practice sessions of the students.
