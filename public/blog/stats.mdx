It became pretty apparent early on that having a practice console alone is not that useful without any way to keep track of practice sessions.  So the natural progression was to build a mechanism to keep a history of the practice sessions without having the users log in.  Without the users logging in, one of the few ways to keep track of the practice sessions is to store it at the browser.  So this limits the ability for a user to view his/her stats on the same browser that he/she practices on.  The [Stats page](/stats) keep track of the words/characters per minute count as well as the accuracy (number of words/characters correct / number of correct words/characters) of each session.  A user can view the progression of his/her practice on a chart to see if he/she is improving.  Ultimately, this app needs to show value in improving a typist's speed and accuracy of his/her typing.
