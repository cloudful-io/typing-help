In order to be a useful web app, we will need to keep track of who is using it.  With the prevalence of Gmail, my first choice is to integrate my authentication with Google.  Users can sign up for an account on Typing Help with their Google account in seconds - without any need to confirm your email or phone number.  Obviously, this will not be the only way a user can authenticate in the future, but this is the first of many email providers we will tackle first.
