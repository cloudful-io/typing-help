In addition to allowing users to sign in using their Google account, I have just added the ability for users to create a new account, and sign in using any email address.  This expands our user base to those who do not have a Gmail address.  You simply provide your email address and enter a password of your choice.  An email will be sent to your address to confirm your identity.  Once confirmed, you will immediately be able to sign in using your email address and password.  Also, in case you forget your password in the future, it also allows you to reset your password.
