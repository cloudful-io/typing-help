I am excited to announce the launch of our very first typing game on Typing Help — a fun and interactive way to improve your typing skills while keeping learning engaging. Games play a powerful role in learning because they transform practice into play, making repetition enjoyable instead of tedious. By turning skill-building into a challenge, learners stay motivated, track their progress naturally, and build confidence through instant feedback. This first game - [Word Rain](/game/word-rain) - marks the beginning of my mission to make typing practice more immersive and rewarding. Stay tuned — more games and features are on the way to help you type faster, more accurate, and with a smile.
