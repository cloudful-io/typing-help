Welcome to Typing Help!  An app that I built for my 11-year-old daughter to help her to be a better typist in Chinese.  She joined her Chinese school typing team over the summer with the hope that she would be competing in the Fall contest.  Watching her and her classmates practice typing over Zoom, I quickly realized that they could do something better than having each student practice typing on a Google Slide.  The idea was born, and over the course of a long weekend, I was able to put together a proof of concept that allows a student to practice typing given some sample text, and it will tell you whether you have entered each character correctly or incorrectly.  In addition, typing is all about speed and accuracy, so I provided statistics that the teacher will be able to use to pick out her team for the typing contest.
